# Getting started

AscendKernelBench separates code generation from operator evaluation. You can inspect tasks, prepare prompts, generate candidates through a remote language model, and analyze saved results on macOS. Compiling and evaluating candidates requires a Linux machine with an Ascend NPU and the matching software stack.

## Choose your environment

| Activity | macOS or another machine without an NPU | Linux with Ascend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read tasks and build prompts | Yes | Yes |
| Generate source through a remote endpoint | Yes | Yes |
| Run the static source checker | Yes | Yes |
| Analyze an existing `eval_results.json` | Yes | Yes |
| Compile `custom_op.asc` into `libcustom_op.so` | No, requires the Ascend toolchain | Yes, with the required toolchain |
| Check candidate correctness and measure performance | No | Yes |

The evaluator has a CPU **reference** fallback for tasks that the NPU reference cannot execute. The candidate still runs on the NPU; this is not a CPU evaluation mode. Similarly, `--no-perf` skips timing but still builds and executes the candidate on an NPU.

## Install from a checkout

Use Python **3.10 or newer**. Check `python3 --version` first; on macOS, the system-provided interpreter may be older. If necessary, replace `python3` below with the path to your newer interpreter.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wuzhenqing/AscendKernelBench.git
cd AscendKernelBench
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
```

Run the commands in these guides from the repository root, with the environment activated. Scripts and the isolated eval worker bootstrap the checkout `src/` directory, so an editable install is optional when you already have the third-party dependencies. Tasks, hardware profiles, scripts, and the build template are used directly from the checkout; no dataset submodule initialization is needed.

The base installation provides the Python dependencies for generation and reporting. It does not install PyTorch, `torch_npu`, CANN, the NPU driver, or the native build toolchain.

For linting and unit tests, install the development extra and the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest
```

### Ascend host experiment environment

On a Linux machine with CANN 9.1.0, use conda env `akb` (Python 3.12,
PyTorch 2.10.0, torch-npu 2.10.0.post6):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate akb
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann-9.1.0/set_env.sh
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Confirm the NPU is visible before evaluating:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import torch
import torch_npu
print(torch.__version__, torch_npu.__version__, torch.npu.is_available())
PY
```

## Explore tasks without an NPU

Task discovery reads Python source and checks its top-level contract using the Python AST. It does not execute the task or import its PyTorch dependencies.

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from collections import Counter
from ascend_kernel_bench.dataset import discover_tasks, load_task

tasks = discover_tasks()
print("Tasks by level:", dict(sorted(Counter(t.level for t in tasks).items())))
task = load_task("level1/19_ReLU")
print("Example:", task.task_id)
print("Source:", task.path)
PY
```

The committed task set contains 270 tasks across four levels. Use a task ID such as `level1/19_ReLU`, without the `KernelBench/` prefix or `.py` extension. See [task authoring](../task_authoring.md) for the task contract.

You can also inspect exactly what will be sent to the model, without making an API request:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
from ascend_kernel_bench.config import load_hardware_profile
from ascend_kernel_bench.dataset import load_task
from ascend_kernel_bench.prompt import build_prompt

prompt = build_prompt(
    load_task("level1/19_ReLU"),
    load_hardware_profile("ascend910b2"),
    mode="one_shot",
)
Path("relu-prompt.txt").write_text(prompt, encoding="utf-8")
print("Wrote relu-prompt.txt")
PY
```

## Generate your first candidate

Configure an endpoint and a model name that your service actually exposes. The model in the default configuration is a project default, not a guarantee that a particular endpoint serves it.

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL='https://your-endpoint.example/v1'
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export AKB_MODEL='your-served-model-name'

python scripts/generate.py \
  --task level1/19_ReLU \
  --hardware ascend910b2 \
  --model "$AKB_MODEL" \
  --n-samples 1 \
  --run-name relu-demo
```

Replace the placeholder values before running. Generation sends the task source and prompt examples to the configured service. It writes `custom_op.asc`, `model_new.py`, and prompt/response files under `runs/relu-demo/level1/19_ReLU/sample_0/`. It does not build or evaluate the generated operator.

See [LLM service configuration](../deploy_llm_service.md) for endpoint behavior and [workflows](workflows.md) for moving a run to an Ascend machine.

## Prepare an Ascend evaluation machine

The repository's fixed build template expects:

- A Linux host with an accessible Ascend NPU and its driver/runtime.
- A CANN environment providing the `ASC` CMake package/compiler. The template documents CANN 9.1.0 or newer as its requirement.
- A compatible PyTorch and `torch_npu` installation, importable in the active Python environment.
- CMake 3.16 or newer, Python development headers, and a C++17/GCC toolchain with a discoverable `libgcc.a`.

Use the installation and compatibility instructions for the stack on your machine; this repository does not provide a universal version matrix. Some tasks also import additional packages, particularly at level 4. Inspect the selected task's imports before starting a large run.

Set `CANN_SET_ENV` to your installed environment script if it differs from the project default:

```bash
export CANN_SET_ENV=/path/to/cann/set_env.sh
source "$CANN_SET_ENV"

python - <<'PY'
import torch
import torch_npu

print("PyTorch:", torch.__version__)
print("torch_npu:", torch_npu.__version__)
print("NPU available:", torch.npu.is_available())
PY
```

This checks basic imports and device availability. Successful compilation, correctness, and performance must be verified on the target machine. The documentation work performed on macOS does not establish any NPU evaluation result.

Continue with [generation and evaluation workflows](workflows.md), or consult [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if setup fails.
